          <h3>who we are</h3>
          <hr>
          <p>
            WellFed Ltd is an organization that is committed to seeing the end of hunger and malnutrition in Africa, especially in children. As much as we are willing to partner with individuals and relevant organizations, we do not operate as an organization that solely depends on donations and grants alone to achieve this vision. If anyone or organization will donate their hard earned money towards the furtherance of the vision, we want to be able to demonstrate that we are doing exactly the same thing. Therefore, we have built a business around this vision, an “in-house” sponsor of the vision. A portion of every kobo made at WellFed Ltd goes towards reducing the number of starving children in Africa.
          </p>
          
          <h3>how we operate</h3>
          <hr>
          <ul class="list-group">
            <li>
              We own and operate farms that produce quality crops and livestock that meet the need of people. A portion of every kobo made from the operation of our farms go directly to reducing the number of children who starve in Africa. The operation involves actual farming, value addition and marketing.
            </li>
            <li>
              We connect farmers to the market with our extensive marketing infrastructure. The preference of partnership is with farmers who have quality agricultural produce to sell but have difficulty in assessing the markets.
            </li>
            <li>
              There is an outreach arm of the organization that is directly involved in meeting with, and providing food in specific areas of interest, train farmers to improve on best practices that can be employed to improve the quality and quantity of their farm produce, train selected children and give them sound education and mentorship as well as empower women in selected areas.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>what we intend to achieve</h3>
          <hr>
          <ul class="list-group">
            <li>
              Improve the assess that people have to quality and affordable agricultural produce;
            </li>
            <li>
              Directly feed children who are suffering from hunger and starvation;
            </li>
            <li>
              Train children and improve the capacity of young adults (sound education and mentorship) to meet specific needs in the society and earn better living;
            </li>
            <li>
              Empower women who are willing and able to engage in some work to improve their livelihoods.
