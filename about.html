        <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>WHAT ARE WE OUT TO DO</strong></p>
        <p><br />The vision remains stamping hunger out of Africa, with specific focus on Children, and their mothers. As much as we will be open to donations and support from individuals and organizations, we do not want to operate as an entity that solely depends on donations and grants alone to achieve this vision. We want to lead by example. If anyone/organization will donate their hard earned money towards the furtherance of the vision, we want to be able to demonstrate that we are doing exactly the same thing. Therefore, we seek to build a business round this vision, an &ldquo;in-house&rdquo; sponsor of the vision of some sort. Albeit, a business that is not completely detached from the overall vision.</p>
        <p><br /><strong>THE BUSINESS</strong></p>
        <p><br />We decided to go into the AGRIBUSINESS. The structure of the business is summarized below:</p>
        <p><br />1. Involvement in actual crop and livestock farming. This makes business sense, and it is directly linked with our overall vision. For crops, our main target is to focus on off-season farming. We want to contribute to the improvement of the supply of essential agricultural produce, especially when they are naturally expected to be scarce. This does not mean that we will not continually assess the market and have an understanding of what produce(s) have high demand, or the supply gaps in the market. Our farming is both scientific and market oriented. WE WANT TO BE MEETING A SPECIFIC NEED AT A GIVEN TIME. Not just farming for the sake of it. The same logic applies to our livestock farming. While our farming standards will be high (to the point where it will not be impossible to export, if necessary), our focus is on Africa. However, if there is an international need that can be met, we will rise to the occasion. Our farming business can be summarized as &ldquo;Market driven, scientifically sound, 21st century farming&rdquo;.</p>
        <p><br />2. Agro-Processing: We want to add value to our agricultural products. Similar to the logic with the farming, whatever we process must be meeting a specific need, albeit, multidirectional, in this case. While it is important to produce end products whose need in the market have been identified, it is important that as much as possible, our agro-processing improves the farmers, especially those that are involved in highly perishable goods.</p>
        <p><br />3. Customer centric marketing and distribution network. It does the following:<br />a. Connects farmers to the market &ndash; assists the farmers, and improve their livelihoods. Note that if this will achieve our overall vision, our offtake price has to be FAIR! Hence in order to remain profitable, we must come up with creative ways of distributing and marketing at &ldquo;profitable costs&rdquo;.<br />b. Does continuous market research that assists in the decision making of the farming and processing divisions. The division director of distribution and marketing works hand-in-hand with the director of the farming and processing divisions.<br />c. Therefore, at its core, the distribution and marketing division must:<br />i. Be up to date with the current supply gap of livestock and crop produce;<br />ii. Be customer-centric &ndash; Part of our core values is integrity, customers should get exactly what they pay for, and they should be treated with respect.<br />iii. Align itself with the vision of the organization by ensuring fair practices, especially with the farmers.<br />All organs/divisions of the business have some level of autonomy. If for example, the D&amp;M division identifies a gap in a market, and the farming and agro-processing unit cannot serve as a &ldquo;competitive&rdquo; supplier, the D&amp;M might look for a competitive supplier, and the farming and agro-processing must figure out how to make themselves competitive. Though part of the same organization, each division is RESPONSIBLE for its profitability and sustainability. The idea for this is not to create division within the organization, it is to out every director on their toes, and ensure that everyone is working towards the fulfilment of the vision of the organization.</p>
        <p><br /><strong>OUTREACH</strong><br />While it is expected that some of the business activities would have contributed directly to the overall vision of the Organization directly or indirectly, we are also involved in direct interventions at different capacities towards ensuring that every child in Africa gets WellFed! This is summarized with the following:</p>
        <p><br />i. Giving direct food support to a specific community for a given period;<br />ii. Empowering women and young girls; and<br />iii. Mentorship (for young adults)</p>
        <p><br />Details for each division of the business and the outreach (challenges, business plans, detailed &ldquo;how&rdquo; etc.) are contained in their respective specific documents.
